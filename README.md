  ## Personal Project
- Third person arcade game, endless waves of enemies based on selected difficulty
  - Rogue-like perk selection
  - 3D RPG Style
### More info
- Most of the repository is also used to store the shaders and other stuff I've been working with.
- Thus, most of my work can be found under [Assets](./Assets)



### Game Demo - Jan 04, 2024
- The textures are temporary, I am no unity texture designer ðŸ«¡
